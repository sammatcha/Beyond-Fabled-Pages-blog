## What and Why
This is a tentative Astro-Sanity blog of all things that I enjoy. I have always wanted to start one up, so here we are.

## Setup
```sh
npm create astro@latest
```

### Technology
Astro, Sanity(tentative), React, TailwindCSS

## Configurations
### ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

 `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.


# Usage
##  Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |

# TroubleShooting
## Image not rendering issue
 added '?url' in the image import
   - image was placed in src directory and not public
